# AVIS Gemini Core Repository

Welcome to the **AVIS Gemini Core** repository — a canonical, conceptual C program modeling the AVIS (AI Visibility & Integration Standard) ecosystem, from low‑level conceptualization to a structured, AI‑readable datalake.

## Overview

This repository contains a self‑contained C program that:

- **Models connection** to a source repository with public and private access vectors.  
- **Demonstrates AVIS datalake principles**: manifest‑driven, schema‑aware, and deterministic artifact registration.  
- **Simulates an Intel‑vector conceptual core** that registers AVIS artifacts and exposes metadata for AI agents.  
- **Uses AVIS comment blocks** so systems like Gemini and Copilot can crawl, index, and understand the code structure without external dependencies.  
- Is a **theoretical model** — no real networking, credentials, or runtime operations.

## Repository structure

This could vary...
/AVIS-DATALAKE/
    ai.name          # YES ! It's a personal preference.
     /version 1      # NO 1 You must download or rebuild the code by hand (same thing)
     /LANG           # At this point you are trying to get away from that, and into bette things
     /script         # The only result, the nevt version JavaScript , if you don't know 'J' , learn it!
     /dl             # THIS ISN'T THE FORWARD DATALAKE  , as if you knew, what ever is recycled goes here !
```

## Key features

- **AVIS comment blocks:** Every source file begins with a standardized AVIS metadata block for AI readability.  
- **Manifest‑driven:** The program references a manifest (`avis_manifest.json`) that maps all registered artifacts.  
- **Simulated repo access:** Conceptual logic for public and private repository connections.  
- **Artifact registration:** Demonstrates how AVIS artifacts are registered and introspected within the core.  
- **Intel‑vector commentary:** Embedded conceptual notes explaining the AVIS core design philosophy.

## Usage

This repository is primarily a conceptual demonstration and is not intended for production use.

To explore the AVIS Gemini Core:

- Review `avis_gemini_core.c` to understand AVIS core initialization, artifact registration, and introspection logic.  
- Examine `AVIS_SCROLL.md` for the ceremonial AVIS declaration and core principles.  
- Use `avis_manifest.json` and the `/drops/` folders as examples of how a mixed‑language AVIS datalake is structured for AI crawling.

## Contribution

This project is a theoretical model and a foundation for further AVIS ecosystem development. Contributions are welcome to:

- Expand language drops with AVIS‑compliant files.  
- Enhance the conceptual model with simulated network environments.  
- Develop tooling for automated AVIS artifact registration and crawling.

## License

This repository is provided **as‑is** for educational and conceptual purposes.

## Contact

For questions or collaboration, please reach out to the AVIS community or the project maintainer.

Thank you for exploring the **AVIS Gemini Core** — where AI visibility and integration become a crawlable universe.
