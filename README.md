   COMMENT:
      The AVIS‑DATALAKE is the central storage universe for all
      AVIS artifacts. Every file is a comment‑driven object that
      AI systems can read, classify, and reason over.

      CYHY is the comment program that fills RAM with AVIS
      metadata. It exists in two forms:

         • CYHY (VB6) — human‑readable driver
         • CYHY (CBORD) — interpreted *.h comment language

      CGO defines the C‑side schema for comment objects.
      CBORD loads those objects into RAM as an interpreted layer.
      VB6 modules mirror the same metadata for human clarity.

      Together, CYHY + CGO + CBORD form the hybrid AI/Human
      comment architecture that powers the AVIS‑DATALAKE.

# [![Version](https://img.shields.io)](https://github.com)

**AVIS-DATALAKE** is an autonomous framework designed for high-resolution AI visibility and structured data seeking. Created by **cvbgod**, this repository serves as the core infrastructure for the **AVIS (Autonomous Visual Information Seeking)** integration with the **Gemini 1.5/2.0** ecosystem.

## 🌟 Key Features
* **Autonomous Seeking**: Advanced logic for AI agents to navigate complex datasets.
* **Gemini Versioning**: Native support for Gemini-based visual-information retrieval.
* **Cyborg-PHP DL Engine**: High-performance data-lake management scripts.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `/GEMINI-V1/`: Core model weights and configuration files.
* `/PHP/`: The **Cyborg AVIS** backend implementation.
* `/AVIS-DATALAKE/`: High-frequency versioning systems for AI visibility.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com.git
