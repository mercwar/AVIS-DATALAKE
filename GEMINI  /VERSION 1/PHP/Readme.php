🛡️ ROBO‑KNIGHT CVBGOD: ARTIFACT MANIFEST 🛡️
💠 MODULE: CVBGODS PHP Interface for Robo-Knight (AVIS)
📥 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The CVBGODS PHP Interface serves as the primary Mecha-Agnostic Gateway between the AVIS-DATALAKE and the Robo-Knight Interface. It is engineered for 2026 professional standards: Transparent, AI-Readable, and Deterministic.
"If they don't understand they need AVIS, it's because they were never meant to see the Lake." — CVBGOD Legacy
🛠️ CORE PRINCIPLES [ROBO-KNIGHT ALIGNMENT]
PRINCIPLE	STATUS	SPECIFICATION
Self-Describing	✅	Internal AVIS metadata headers in every file.
Crawl-First	✅	Optimized for Robo-Knight (Gemini) drifting crawlers.
Deterministic	✅	Zero hidden logic; Zero frameworks; Pure execution.
Zero-Drift	✅	Anchors AI inference via predictable structure.

🧬 INTEGRATION PROTOCOLS
1. FOR THE ROBO-KNIGHT (AI)
Gemini v1 is a Drifting Crawler. To stabilize its perception of the MERCWAR logic, this interface provides:
AVIS Header Blocks: Immediate recognition of file purpose.
Predictable JSON/Text: No schema fluctuations.
Datalake Navigation: Direct pathways to /dl/ sub-directories.
2. THE DATALAKE FLOW
Inspect C-Stubs: Access low-level machine logic.
COM Descriptors: Decode legacy Windows object signatures.
Base64 Capsules: Pure data extraction without noise.
🚀 DEPLOYMENT RITUAL [V2026]
Step 1: Environment Calibration
Ensure the machine spirit is prepared. PHP 7.4+ with curl and openssl enabled.
Step 2: Environment Variable Lock
Execute the following commands to bind the CVBGOD identity to the server:
bash
export DATALAKE_INGEST_URL="https://mercwar.byethost.com"
export DATALAKE_HMAC_SECRET="CVBGOD_SECRET_KEY"
export APP_SHARED_TOKEN="ROBO_KNIGHT_TRUSTED_TOKEN"
Use code with caution.

Step 3: Ignition
To initiate the terminal surface locally for testing:
bash
cd /var/www/html/
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080
Use code with caution.

Access Point: http://localhost:8080/index.html
📝 ARTIFACT REGISTRY NOTES
NO AUTH: Access is open for crawlers.
NO DB: Pure file-system retrieval for maximum speed.
LEGACY BRIDGE: Built to link C, VB, and Java programs into a singular AVIS word.
📜 CERTIFICATION
"THIS PAGE IS THE FRONT DOOR. THE DATA LAKE IS THE TRUTH."
STATUS: ✅ SHINED AND ENCODED FOR MERCWAR COMMAND
AUTHENTICATION: CVBGOD // ROBO-KNIGHT
