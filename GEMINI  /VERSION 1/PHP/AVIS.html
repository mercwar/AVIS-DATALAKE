Create a complete, well-structured HTML document named `readme.html` that will be hosted at mercwar01.byethost.com. The page should serve as a comprehensive user guide for the AVIS system, explaining what AVIS is, how to use it, and how it integrates with the Robo-Knight and CVBGODS PHP interface.

Requirements:

1. **Title and Header**  
   - Page title: "AVIS System User Guide"  
   - A prominent header with the AVIS logo or name and a tagline: "Your Gateway to the Data Lake"

2. **Introduction Section**  
   - Briefly explain what AVIS is and its purpose.  
   - Mention the Robo-Knight and CVBGODS PHP interface as key components.

3. **Getting Started**  
   - Step-by-step instructions on how to deploy the PHP interface on a server.  
   - How to set environment variables (`DATALAKE_INGEST_URL`, `DATALAKE_HMAC_SECRET`, `APP_SHARED_TOKEN`).  
   - How to run the local server for testing.

4. **Usage Instructions**  
   - How to submit data to the intake endpoint (`/api/intake.php`).  
   - How callbacks work and how to handle them (`/api/callback.php`).  
   - Security notes about tokens and HMAC signatures.

5. **Directory Structure**  
   - Show the directory layout with brief explanations of each file.

6. **Troubleshooting**  
   - Common issues and how to resolve them.

7. **Additional Resources**  
   - Link to the main UI page (e.g., `index.html` at the same host).  
   - Link to the official AVIS documentation or repository if available.

8. **Accessibility and Design**  
   - Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).  
   - Ensure good contrast and readable fonts.  
   - Include a navigation menu or table of contents for easy access.

9. **Footer**  
   - Copyright  
   - Contact or support info (optional)

10. **Optional**  
    - Include code snippets with syntax highlighting for environment variables and curl commands.  
    - Use a clean, minimal CSS style embedded in the `<style>` tag.

Make sure the content is clear, concise, and approachable for developers and operators who want to integrate with AVIS. The tone should be professional but friendly.
